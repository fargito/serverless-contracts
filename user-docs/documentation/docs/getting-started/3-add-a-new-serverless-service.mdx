# Add a new Serverless service

## Generate a new service

Let's add a new `users` service to the project by running the following command at the root of the repository:

```bash
pnpm generate-service users
```

:::info
The `generate-service` command is a shorthand for the following command defined in the root `package.json` file:

```bash
pnpm nx generate @swarmion/nx-plugin:service
```

To have more info on the `@swarmion/nx-plugin`, you can check its [documentation page](../how-to-guides/use-swarmion-generators).
:::

The `backend/users` folder containing the `users` service has been added. The project dependency graph now looks like the following:

import ThemedImage from '@theme/ThemedImage';
import swarmionAppUsersGraphLight from '../../static/screenshots/swarmion-app-users-graph-light.png';
import swarmionAppUsersGraphDark from '../../static/screenshots/swarmion-app-users-graph-dark.png';

<div
  style={{
    width: '100%',
    display: 'flex',
    'justify-content': 'center',
    'margin-bottom': 'var(--ifm-leading)',
  }}
>
  <ThemedImage
    alt="Swarmion app with users service"
    sources={{
      light: swarmionAppUsersGraphLight,
      dark: swarmionAppUsersGraphDark,
    }}
  />
</div>

:::info
The `implicit` dependency between `backend-users` and `backend-core` denotes a deployment dependency. Since the `backend-users` service is using a ressource of `backend-core` (the API Gateway), we must ensure that the `backend-core` service is deployed before the `backend-users` service.

This dependency is specified in the `backend/users/project.json` file. You can find out more on how it works in the [dedicated nx documentation](https://nx.dev/configuration/projectjson#files-&-implicit-dependencies).
:::

## Deploy the service

By deploying the service, the following architecture will be deployed:

import backendUsersArchitecture from '../../static/schemas/backend-users-architecture.png';

<div
  style={{
    width: '100%',
    display: 'flex',
    'justify-content': 'center',
    'margin-bottom': 'var(--ifm-leading)',
  }}
>
  <img
    src={backendUsersArchitecture}
    alt="backend-users architecture"
    width="500px"
  />
</div>

The service defines a lambda called `my-project-name-users-dev-health`. The API Gateway from the `core` is reused and now will expose a new endpoint `GET /users/health` which is an integration with the Lambda. Calling the endpoint will execute the Lambda and return the result.

You can find the definition of the lambda in the `backend/users/functions/health/config.ts` file.

You can deploy the service by running the following command at the root of the repository:

```bash
cd backend/users
pnpm serverless deploy
# It should prompt something like the following:
Deploying my-project-name-users to stage dev (us-east-1)

âœ” Service deployed to stack my-project-name-users-dev (116s)

endpoint: GET - https://b1c15ee1u8.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/users/health
functions:
  health: my-project-name-users-dev-health (933 B)
```

Calling the endpoint will return the following response:

```bash
http https://b1c15ee1u8.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/users/health
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Apigw-Requestid: XejEWgsdoAMEV8w=
Connection: keep-alive
Content-Length: 2
Content-Type: application/json
Date: Fri, 26 Aug 2022 15:22:54 GMT

ok
```

## Deploy the whole project in order

Now that the project has two services, it would be really cumbersome to deploy them one after the other. Thankfully, we can deploy the whole project in order by running the following command at the root of the repository:

```bash
pnpm deploy
```

This command will leverage the dependency graph of the project and deploy all the services in the right order. This means that `backend-core` will be deployed, then `backend-users`.

## Wrap up

You now have deployed an application with two microservices: `core` and `users`. Let's take a look on how to add a shared TypeScript library to the project, to allow code sharing between the two services.
